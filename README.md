# Deep-Learning-Project
Final group project with Sophie Berchtold, Sharon Bures, and Cara Grimm

Authors: Sophie Berchtold, Sharon Bures, and Cara Grimm

Course: Deep Learning for Social Sciences (SS 2024)

## Project Overview
This Project investigates the application of GNNs for detecting fake news by analyzing the relationships and structures within social media data. The Project is documented in the deep-learning.ipynb notebook.

## Repository Structure
The project data and outputs are organized in following structure:
-  nx_network_data: contains the used GossipCop dataset (labeled fake and real news from tweets + network of retweets of the original tweet)
-  Training GCN: contains the training data of the GCN model (loss curves and training results)
-  Training GAT: contains the training data of the GAT model (loss curves and training results)

## Data Sources 
The data used in this project is sourced from: https://github.com/mdepak/fake-news-propagation/tree/master
