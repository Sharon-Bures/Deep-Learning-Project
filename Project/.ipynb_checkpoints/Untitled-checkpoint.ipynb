Sources say that dealmaking process is in a sensitive stage.\\n\\nInsiders say Boyle will is flying to Los Angeles to meet with actress to play one of the female leads, an assistant to Jobs. Insiders say that Jessica Chastain is one of the actresses on the meeting list.\\n\\nWozniak, known as \"Woz,\" co-founded Apple with Jobs and Ronald Wayne.
